Tomcat can be configured to read files from anywhere on disk and serve them on a specific URL. This configuration is completely separate to your application config – you could, if you wanted, just start Tomcat and have it serve static files from disk with no webapps running. The configuration is in Tomcat’s server.xml configuration file and looks like this (the bit that needs to be added is in red):


  <Host appBase="webapps"
		   autoDeploy="false" name="localhost" unpackWARs="true"
		   xmlNamespaceAware="false" xmlValidation="false">
	...
	<Context docBase="/home/stuff" path="/static" />

  </Host>

A <Context> element is added inside the <Host> element. Context has two attributes: docBase is the directory on disk that contains your static files and path is the URL that you want to serve the files on.

Make sure that Tomcat has access to read the files in docBase.
