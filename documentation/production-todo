How to run
----------

Setting up the environments requires virtualbox, vagrant and ansible.
To set up, simply run `vagrant up` in the directories `training_environment` or `production_environment`.


Architecture
------------

All systems are based on the vagrant image bento/debian-8.5 (https://atlas.hashicorp.com/bento/boxes/debian-8.5).
To serve the war file in each environment, I chose tomcat because it is an apache project.


Training environment
--------------------

Here tomcat also serves the static files, so it is literally the only service defined there.
Tomcat's listen port is `8080` and it is forwarded to that same port on the vagrant host machine.
The log directory is synced to the host into the `logs` directory.


Production environment
----------------------

The production setup looks roughly as follows:

Internet --> load balancers [haproxy] --> appservers [tomcat8] / staticservers [gatling]

haproxy redirects the request to the appropriate backend (appservers/static) based on the request url.
It could also be used to collect statistics.









upcoming release:
=================

setup
    - reduce sudo
    - ansible handlers & ...?

load-balancing
    - fine-tune configs

deployment plan
    - deploy via ansible (if possible)


further development:
====================

log-setup
    - self-hosted vs cloud

monitoring
    - availability-monitoring
    - service-quality-monitoring
    - external alerting service

consider a (R)DBMS
    - think about data flow in the app

scaling / rolling releases


big rollout:
============

CDN
global availability
