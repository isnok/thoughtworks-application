How to run
----------

Setting up the environments requires virtualbox, vagrant and ansible.
To set up, simply run `vagrant up` in the directories `training_environment` or `production_environment`.


Architecture
------------

All systems are based on the vagrant image bento/debian-8.5 (https://atlas.hashicorp.com/bento/boxes/debian-8.5).
To serve the war file in each environment, I chose tomcat, because it is an apache project.
It also serves the static files in the training environment, so it is really the only service running there.
